# Installation and Setup Guide

## 1. Install Dependencies for the Server and Client

### **Server Setup:**
1. Navigate to the server directory:

    ```bash
    cd server
    ```
2. Install the server dependencies:

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

### **Client Setup:**
1. Navigate to the client directory:

    ```bash
    cd client
    ```
2. Install the client dependencies:

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```


## 2. Set Up Environment Variables

Since this project utilizes cookies for authentication, you need to create a `.env` file to store sensitive information, such as the `JWT_SECRET`.

### **Steps to Set Up the .env File:**

1. Create a `.env` file in the root directory of the server (if it doesn't already exist).

2. Add the following environment variable to the `.env` file:

    ```env
    JWT_SECRET=your_secret_key_here
    ```

   Replace `your_secret_key_here` with a strong, secure secret key used for signing JWT tokens.

3. Ensure that the server is able to read environment variables by using the `dotenv` package (which should already be included in the server dependencies).

### **Important Note:**

- The `.env` file is **not** included in version control (e.g., Git) by default. It‚Äôs important to ensure that this file is added to `.gitignore` to prevent accidental exposure of sensitive data.
File must be created in Server folder.


## 3. Running the Application

### **Server:**

The server handles the API requests and is set to run on `http://localhost:7777`.

1. Open a terminal and navigate to the `server` directory:

    ```bash
    cd server
    ```

2. Install the server dependencies (if you haven't already):

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3. Start the server by running the following command:

    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

   The server should now be running at `http://localhost:7777`.

### **Client:**

The client is a React-based front-end application that communicates with the server. It runs on `http://localhost:5173`.

1. Open a new terminal and navigate to the `client` directory:

    ```bash
    cd client
    ```

2. Install the client dependencies (if you haven't already):

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3. Start the client by running the following command:

    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

   The client should now be accessible at `http://localhost:5173`.

### **Note:**

- You must run the server and client in separate terminal windows. Both need to be running simultaneously to interact with each other.

   Make sure you have both terminals open and executing the `npm run dev` command in their respective directories (`client` and `server`).



## Online Store - [Go to the Application](http://localhost:5173/)


## Public Part 

Here are the public parts of the application:

- ‚úÖ **Home Page**
- ‚úÖ **Register Page**
- ‚úÖ **Login Page**
- ‚úÖ **Catalog Page**
- ‚úÖ **Details Page**



## Private Part 

- üîí **Personal Catalog/Profile**: A space where users can view and manage their own products.


## Features and Implementation üõ†Ô∏è

### **Custom Hooks:**
In the application, custom hooks are used to handle various tasks like authentication, form management, and CRUD operations for products:

- **useLogin**: Handles user login and updates the authentication state.
- **useRegister**: Handles user registration and updates the authentication state.
- **useLogout**: Handles user logout by clearing authentication data.
- **useForm**: Manages form states and submission.
- **usePersistedState**: Persists authentication state in `localStorage` and fetches user data.
- **useGetAllItems**: Fetches and displays all items from the server.
- **useGetOneItem**: Fetches details of a specific item and handles error states.
- **useCreateItem**: Handles creating a new product.


### **Context API:**
The application uses **Context API** to manage global authentication state across the app. The authentication context is shared with all components to handle user login, registration, and logout.

- **AuthContext**: This context holds authentication data such as `userId`, `email`, and `isAuthenticated` and provides methods for changing authentication state and logging out.


### **Route Guards:**

The application has route guards to control access based on authentication state.
Guest Access:

Unauthenticated users can access the following pages:

- **Home**
- **Register**
- **Login**
- **Catalog**
- **Details (view-only, no edit/delete buttons)**

User Access:

Authenticated users can access additional features:

- **Home**
- **Catalog (with full management capabilities)**
- **Logout**
- **Details (shows Edit and Delete buttons if the user is the owner, otherwise a Buy button)**
- **Create (add new items)**
- **Edit (modify existing items)**
- **Personal Space (manage user-owned items)**

This setup ensures that guests can browse but not modify content, while logged-in users have full management access.


### **React Components & Client-Side Routing:**

The application is built using React components. Each feature and page is encapsulated in its own component for better maintainability and scalability.

- **Component-Based Structure: The app consists of separate components for different pages and functionalities, ensuring a clean and structured codebase.**
- **Client-Side Routing: The app utilizes React Router to enable seamless navigation without reloading the page.**
- **Defined Routes: Navigation between different pages is handled in the App component with routes such as:**
- **‚úÖ Public Routes: /home, /catalog**
- **‚úÖ Guest-Only Routes: /login, /register**
- **üîí Protected Routes (Authenticated Users Only): /create, /:itemId/edit, /personalCatalog**
- **üîÑ Dynamic Routes: /:itemId (fetching item details dynamically)**

This enhances the user experience by making navigation faster and smoother while keeping the application lightweight and efficient.
